Team Pier Pressure proudly announces our Global Game Jam 2017 game (Theme: Waves) 

Race to Treasure Island

Top-down side-scrolling boat race game.

Player must keep up and pass the British Naval Vessels and rival pirates, while adapting their sails to incoming waves. Players will also have to tend with floating obstacles and dolphins in their path. 

Players move by using the space bar. Pressing it as frequently as they can to go as fast they can.
Using the fire cannons buttons, players can shoot other ships to slow them down and shoot obstacles in the way.
Players will also need to time their boats crossing waves and furl their sails to avoid being slowed down.
If done correctly, players get a speed boost. 
They also need to remember to unfurl their sails after passing the wave.
